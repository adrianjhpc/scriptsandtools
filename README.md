# scriptsandtools
This repository stores scripts and small tools I've developed over the years

# mpilauncher
This contains a custom bash script that parses a PBS node file and creates a custom configuration file for mpirun to launch a job across one or more nodes.

# JobWrapper
Job Wrapper is a utility design to run multiple executables on a single compute node.
It was created to get around the restriction that some HPC system have on running more than one executable on a single node.

# PythonTaskFarm
The PythonTaskFarm will take a serial python program and run it on one or more cores using MPI.

# NGIOBenchmarksDataHandling
Python programs to parse and process data generated by some of the NEXTGenIO benchmarks (git.ph.ed.ac.uk/nextgenio/benchmarks.git).

#PlacementAndBinding
Versions of the xthi program to test MPI process placement, OpenMP thread binding, and hybrid combinations of the two.
