# PythonTaskFarm
The python taskfarm (ptf) takes a serial python program and runs it on a number of cores in parallel using MPI.
It is designed to allow a serial python program to be run multiple times using a parallel machine.

# Source code

The src directory has the taskfarm source code and a Makefile for it.

# Example scripts for runing the ptf

The test directory has a number of example python programs and a submission script that would run one of them on a Cray XC30.
