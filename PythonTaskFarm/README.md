The python taskfarm takes a serial python program and runs it on a number of cores in parallel using MPI.
It is designed to allow a serial python program to be run multiple times using a parallel machine.

The src directory has the taskfarm source code and a Makefile for it.

The test directory has a number of example python programs and a submission script that would run one of them on a Cray XC30.
